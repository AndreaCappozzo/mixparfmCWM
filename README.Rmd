# mixparfmCWM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mixparfmCWM is to provide a flexible framework for fitting finite mixtures of parametric frailty models with random covariates. Possible baseline hazards: exponential, Weibull, inverse Weibull (Fréchet), Gompertz, lognormal, log-skew-normal, and loglogistic. Possible Frailty distributions: gamma, positive stable, inverse Gaussian and lognormal. Heavily relies on the forked version of [parfm](https://github.com/AndreaCappozzo/parfm) R package.

This repository is associated with the paper *Cluster-weighted modeling of lifetime hierarchical data for profiling COVID-19 heart failure patients (2025+)* by Caldera, Cappozzo, Masci, Forlani, Antonelli, Leoni, Paganoni, Ieva.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mixparfmCWM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AndreaCappozzo/mixparfmCWM")
```

Note: for the mixparfmCWM package to function correctly, the development version of parfm—which has been slightly modified and extended to address the specific challenges of our framework—is required. You can install the development version of parfm using the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AndreaCappozzo/parfm")
```
