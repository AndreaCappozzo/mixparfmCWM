# mixparfmCWM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mixparfmCWM is to provide a flexible framework for fitting
finite mixtures of parametric frailty models with random covariates.
Possible baseline hazards: exponential, Weibull, inverse Weibull
(Fr√©chet), Gompertz, lognormal, log-skew-normal, and loglogistic.
Possible Frailty distributions: gamma, positive stable, inverse Gaussian
and lognormal. Heavily relies on the
[parfm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parfm/index.html) R
package.
